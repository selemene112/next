## About The Project

<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ankasa Web project is a front-end web application designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly platform for booking and exploring a diverse range of flight tickets. This project makes use of cutting-edge technologies including Node.js, Next.js, Bootstrap, React-Bootstrap and CSS. Whether you're an avid traveler searching for flight options, planning your next vacation, or just in need of booking assistance, this platform has got you covered.</p>


## Built With

This Web was built with some technologies below:

- [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [React Bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap)

## Installation

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Structur Folder 
In this project I used ATOMIC Design to shorten development time
The folder structure is:

| Structur Folder  |
| ------------- |
| ![Regis.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkucquakt/image/upload/v1699863439/Screenshot_from_2023-11-13_16-11-33_fwhrxs.png) |


The display for this project is as follows :

| Login | Register |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ![Login.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkucquakt/image/upload/v1699864160/Screenshot_from_2023-11-13_16-29-05_cbp4xm.png) |![Register.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkucquakt/image/upload/v1699863965/Screenshot_from_2023-11-13_16-25-32_idtwyj.png) |

In this display we can see that the frames from both websites are almost the same but the only difference is the filling column and its function, therefore this is where ATOMIC Design functions, where we only create a frame for the Auth display once and use Cildren so that it can be used and used. combine with others


| Code For Template Auth | 
| ------------- |
| !CodeTemp.png(https://res.cloudinary.com/dkucquakt/image/upload/v1699864576/Screenshot_from_2023-11-13_16-34-49_ur9cpq.png) |

Where the code above will create a CLEAN CODE that only creates it once for the template.

| Search AND Pagnation | 
| ------------- |
| ![CodeTemp.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkucquakt/image/upload/v1699864988/Screenshot_from_2023-11-13_16-42-45_ibe3lv.png) |

This is the View of Searching and Pagnation
where if we are looking for the ticket we want, just write it in the Searching column
and there are several shorting features so that the user experience is better

If we press Select then we will be directed to the following display

| Booking Detail | 
| ------------- |
| ![CodeTemp.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkucquakt/image/upload/v1699865281/Screenshot_from_2023-11-13_16-47-48_dazrhi.png) |

On this page we book tickets by entering the name of the customer
and if so, we will be directed to the payment page as follows:

| Payment Page | 
| ------------- |
| ![CodeTemp.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkucquakt/image/upload/v1699865475/Screenshot_from_2023-11-13_16-51-03_abvxx9.png) |

On this page we will fill in the card data that we use to pay for tickets
and after payment is complete you will be redirected to the ticket details page

| Detail Tiket After Payment | 
| ------------- |
| ![CodeTemp.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkucquakt/image/upload/v1699865616/Screenshot_from_2023-11-13_16-53-22_p5ls9r.png) |


After we make a booking, we can see several tickets that have been booked in our profile
